## gulp tasks

### Babel

The generator supports ES 2015 syntax through babel transforming. You may have a source files in `script.babel` if your project has been generated without `--no-babel` options. While developing, When those of source has been changed, `gulp babel` should be run before test and run a extension on Chrome.

```sh
gulp babel
```

If you would like to have a continuous transforming by babel you can use `watch` task

### Watch

Watch task helps you reduce your efforts during development extensions. If the task detects your changes of source files, re-compile your sources automatically or Livereload([chromereload.js](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-chrome-extension/blob/master/app/templates/scripts/chromereload.js)) reloads your extension. If you would like to know more about Live-reload and preview of Yeoman? Please see [Getting started with Yeoman and generator-webapp](http://youtu.be/zBt2g9ekiug?t=3m51s) for your understanding.

```bash
gulp watch
```

### Build and Package

It will build your app as a result you can have a distribution version of the app in `dist`. Run this command to build your Chrome Extension app.

```bash
gulp build
```

You can also distribute your project with compressed file using the Chrome Developer Dashboard at Chrome Web Store. This command will compress your app built by `gulp build` command.
